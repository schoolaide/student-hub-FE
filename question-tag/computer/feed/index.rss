										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Just this week I started working for a new company. I’ve been developing code and going through the database the past couple of days on my machine. Everything is working fine, I set up a new account and it’s hooked into the domain and everything.</p>
<p>Today, the Director IT gave me a “work” computer. It’s running Windows XP with 3 GB of ram, and has a 11 inch screen. He also mentioned I could possibly use a remote desktop for development.</p>
<p>This would make it incredibly difficult for me.</p>
<p>I have a 2012 Retina Display Macbook Pro, running Windows 7, with 8GB RAM, Core i7, etc. I am much more comfortable with it, and it has the power I need to get the job done and run the multiple programs with no lag.</p>
