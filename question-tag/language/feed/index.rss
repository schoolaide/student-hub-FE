										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you asked this question in 2011, the reply would have been: “probably yes, but only because of the massively huge code base developed in 15 years”.</p>
<p>In 2017, we have to reply: “There has been a disruptive factor called PHP 7. It changed a lot in the backend development perspective”.</p>
<p>PHP 5.5+ had been a big step up already. From the ancient, C flavoured spaghetti code, to a proper rich and modern language.<br />
PHP 7 is not “just” monstruosly fast (it’s been reenginered from scratch), it also takes a LOT of the “good stuff” from Java and other good languages and makes it extremely easy to create proper code.<br />
Code fast, code fast code (!) and have nothing special to install. No stale compiled files, no need for complicated sources building software, no need for a compiler at all.</p>
