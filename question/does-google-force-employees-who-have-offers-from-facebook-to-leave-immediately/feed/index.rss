					<description><![CDATA[I know people who left Google for Facebook, they were not walked out. Why would they be walked out of Google? Because facebook competing with Google?

I have left Google twice, both times for Apple, in both cases Apple was a competing organization, in all cases I had a good talk with my managers up and HR discying opportunities in Google, in both cases I was not escorted, I was given two weeks to talk more and to complete my project. I left in good terms with all my friends, managers and Google. Google is very fair organization, it treats people extremely well . I can imagine that some department might be supersecret and they will do it, but I was working for core search quality which is secretive too and I was asked to leave.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[No, definitely not, as others have written.
It’s an extremely terrible policy to do so. I once worked for a company, that had the stated policy that security will escort you out of the building immediately upon you giving notice.
So what happened? I gave notice by emptying my office one night.
They had absolutely no opportunity to attempt to retain me. Crap policy, their fault, good riddance.
(They also had a non-compete that said you could never work for Microsoft. Made them modify that clause before I signed to only apply to the SQL Server group, but should have known they were screwed in the head then. Apparently they are still in business; this was 20 years ago.)]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[When I was at Facebook, 2013–2016, the rumor I heard was the opposite.

It was my understanding that Google practically had a policy of counter-offering anyone who got an offer from Facebook, and that seeking an offer from Facebook was a strategy Googlers used to up their compensation.

Ironically, Facebook had the opposite policy: If you get an offer from elsewhere, it was Facebook’s policy not to counter-offer. Facebook’s view is that if they start counter-offering, they will get into a compensation arms race. And besides, if you really want to go work somewhere else, then maybe you should. There are lots of people who would love to work at Facebook; they don’t need to try to convince you to stay if you want to leave. And if you’re just bluffing, well good on them for not falling for it.]]></description>
