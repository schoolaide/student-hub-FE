					<description><![CDATA[Back-End Developers concentrate on what goes on behind the scenes of a website. These are the people who build the databases that host the site’s content and implement the technologies that runs its search and e-commerce capabilities. Focused more on the website’s responsiveness and speed than what its pages look like, they’re skilled in languages such as Python and PHP, and frameworks like Django and Ruby on Rails.

Senior Web developers’ pay ranges from $52,000 to $107,000, says PayScale, and experience with technologies like C# and Java can result in even more money.]]></description>
