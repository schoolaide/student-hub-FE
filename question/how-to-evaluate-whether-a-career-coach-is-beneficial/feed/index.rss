					<description><![CDATA[First of all, build a list of career coaches available in your area. Try to rank them according to critics, comments, availability … Then, meet some of them, for a first interview, to discy what you are looking for and how you can be helped.

You should look for people who have a high availability, and for experimented professionals. Ask them for references on similar coaching missions. Take the time to meet several of them – as you would do for any job interview.]]></description>

					<description><![CDATA[Think about where you see yourself in 5 years time. Based on that, look through LinkedIn profiles and ask people out for coffee and conduct informational interviews. Learn more about what they do, what challenges they face, and what they enjoy about the work that they do. You need to learn the in’s and out’s before you make a career switch. Do your homework.

You only live life once so make it the best.

Hope that helps.]]></description>

Hiring a career coach is similar to buying food : if you want to play the price game, don’t expect top-notch quality. If you decide to engage in a coaching relation, you need to be comfortable with spending enough for the advice to be actually valuable.

You have no way of knowing beforehand whether or not it will be beneficial for you. It’s similar to seeing a psychologist : for some people, it makes wonders, for some people, it doesn’t do much. However, career coaches are professionals, and if you cannot solve an orientation problem yourself, they are the best suited people to help you.

You will only know how beneficial it was when you will have a new job. If you are happier, it was beneficial, otherwise, it probably wasn’t.]]></description>

Talking about it with the coach is a good idea. Having an other opinion will surely help you. Depending on the country some assiociation exist for this topic and you can contact them for free.]]></description>
